      <h2>What is a Good ACT Percentile?</h2>
      <p>
        The national average ACT score is roughly a <strong>19-20</strong>, which falls near the 50th percentile. Whether your score is "good" depends entirely on your goals:
      </p>
      <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 not-prose my-8">
        <div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-xl border border-indigo-100">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-indigo-900 mb-2">Top 10% (30-36)</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-indigo-700">
            Scores in this range make you a strong candidate for the most selective universities in the US, including Ivy League schools, Stanford, MIT, and top-20 programs. A 34+ puts you in the 99th percentile — elite territory.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-xl border border-blue-100">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-900 mb-2">Top 25% (25-29)</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-blue-700">
            This is a solid range for state flagship universities, many private colleges, and merit scholarship consideration. A 27+ opens doors at schools like University of Michigan, UT Austin, and similar institutions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-amber-50 p-6 rounded-xl border border-amber-100">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-amber-900 mb-2">Top 50% (20-24)</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-amber-700">
            You are scoring above average nationally. This range is sufficient for admission to many four-year colleges and universities. Scores of 23-24 are particularly competitive at moderately selective schools.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-xl border border-slate-100">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Below 20</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
            Below the national average. While this does not prevent college admission, it may limit options at four-year institutions. Community colleges and open-admission universities typically do not have minimum score requirements.

      <h2>ACT Section Percentiles</h2>
      <p>
        Your ACT Composite score is the average of your four (or three, if skipping Science) section scores. But percentiles for individual sections can reveal important strengths and weaknesses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>English:</strong> The average score is around 19. A 30+ puts you in the 90th+ percentile for this section. Students who read frequently tend to score highest here.</li>
        <li><strong>Math:</strong> The average is approximately 19-20. Math percentiles tend to be slightly more compressed at the top — a 30 in Math is roughly the 90th percentile.</li>
        <li><strong>Reading:</strong> Average around 20-21. This section tests reading speed and comprehension. Time management is critical since you have limited time per passage.</li>
        <li><strong>Science:</strong> Average around 20. Despite its name, the ACT Science section is primarily a data interpretation and scientific reasoning test, not a test of science content knowledge.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If one section score is significantly lower than your others, improving it is the most efficient way to raise your Composite. For example, raising your weakest section by 3 points increases your Composite by approximately 1 point.
      </p>

      <h2>How ACT Percentiles Compare to SAT</h2>
      <p>
        If you have taken both tests, you can use the percentile to determine which score is relatively stronger:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>30 ACT</strong> (93rd percentile) is approximately equivalent to a <strong>1360-1380 SAT</strong>.</li>
        <li>A <strong>25 ACT</strong> (77th percentile) is approximately equivalent to a <strong>1200-1220 SAT</strong>.</li>
        <li>A <strong>20 ACT</strong> (54th percentile) is approximately equivalent to a <strong>1030-1050 SAT</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Use the concordance tool above to find your exact SAT equivalent and compare percentiles directly.
