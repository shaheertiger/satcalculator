        How to Calculate Your SAT Score
      </h1>
      <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        Wondering <strong>how to calculate SAT score</strong> results from your raw answers? Here is the step-by-step breakdown of how the College Board turns your raw answers into a scaled score on the 400-1600 scale.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Content -->
    <article class="prose prose-slate max-w-3xl mx-auto">
      <h2>The Basic Formula</h2>
      <p>
        Your total SAT score is the sum of two section scores:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reading and Writing (RW):</strong> 200-800 points</li>
        <li><strong>Math:</strong> 200-800 points</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Total Score = RW Score + Math Score</strong> (Range: 400-1600)
      </p>
      <p>
        Each section contributes equally to your total. A student scoring 700 in both sections would have a total of 1400. The median score is approximately 1050, meaning roughly half of test-takers score above and half below that mark.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Calculate Your Raw Score</h2>
      <p>
        Your "raw score" is the number of questions you answered correctly in each section. This is the starting point for all scoring calculations.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is <strong>no penalty for guessing</strong>. Incorrect answers count as 0 points, not negative points. This is a change from the pre-2016 SAT, which deducted 1/4 point for wrong answers.</li>
        <li><strong>Reading & Writing:</strong> 54 questions total (2 modules of 27). Maximum raw score = 54.</li>
        <li><strong>Math:</strong> 44 questions total (2 modules of 22). Maximum raw score = 44.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Simply count the number of correct answers in each section. Do not subtract for incorrect answers or blank responses.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2: Account for Module Difficulty</h2>
      <p>
        This is the step that makes Digital SAT scoring different from any previous version. Because the test is adaptive, your raw score alone does not determine your scaled score — the <strong>difficulty path</strong> matters too.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hard Module 2:</strong> If you performed well on Module 1 and were routed to the harder second module, your scoring ceiling is higher. Getting 38/44 correct on the hard path might yield a 760 in math.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy Module 2:</strong> If you were routed to the easier second module, the same 38/44 correct answers might only yield a 620-640 because of the lower scoring ceiling.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is why two students with identical raw scores can receive very different scaled scores — the difficulty of the questions they answered makes a significant difference.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 3: Convert to Scaled Score (Equating)</h2>
      <p>
        You cannot simply multiply your raw score by a fixed number to get your scaled score. The College Board uses a statistical process called <strong>equating</strong> to account for small differences in difficulty between different test versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equating ensures that a score of 1400 on the March test represents the same academic ability as 1400 on the October test, even though the questions were completely different.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, on one test date, a raw math score of 40/44 might result in a <strong>760</strong>. On a harder test date, that same 40/44 might be worth a <strong>780</strong> because the equating process recognized the test was more difficult.
      </p>

      <h2>The Digital SAT Difference</h2>
      <p>
        On the <a href="/digital-sat-score-calculator" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">Digital SAT</a>, scoring is more complex than the old paper test due to <strong>Item Response Theory (IRT)</strong>. Here is what makes it different:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Not all questions are worth the same amount.</strong> Each question has unique statistical parameters (difficulty, discrimination, guessing) that determine its weight in your final score.</li>
        <li><strong>Harder questions are worth more.</strong> A correct answer on a difficult question boosts your score more than a correct answer on an easy question.</li>
        <li><strong>The module path affects your ceiling.</strong> Being routed to the easy Module 2 caps your maximum score at approximately 600-650 per section, regardless of how many questions you answer correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>Scores are pre-equated.</strong> Unlike the paper SAT where curves were calculated after the test, Digital SAT questions are pre-calibrated with known IRT parameters, allowing for faster score reporting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because of this complexity, it is impossible to calculate your exact Digital SAT score manually with 100% precision. However, you can use our <a href="/sat-score-calculator" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">SAT Score Calculator</a> to get a highly accurate estimate based on official practice test curves.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Scoring Misconceptions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>"Each question is worth X points"</strong> — This is not how the Digital SAT works. Question weights vary based on IRT parameters.</li>
        <li><strong>"The curve is the same for every test"</strong> — Each test form has its own equating table. What costs you 10 points on one form might cost 20 on another.</li>
        <li><strong>"I need to answer every question correctly to get an 800"</strong> — On some harder test forms, you can miss 1-2 questions and still receive a perfect 800 in a section.</li>
        <li><strong>"Leaving questions blank is better than guessing"</strong> — There is no guessing penalty. Always answer every question.</li>
      </ul>
