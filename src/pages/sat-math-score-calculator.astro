      <h2>Focusing on the Math Section</h2>
      <p>
        The Math section makes up 50% of your total SAT score (800 out of 1600). It consists of two modules, each with 22 questions (44 total).
      </p>
      
      <h3>Math Section Breakdown</h3>
      <p>
        To get a high score, you need mastery in four key areas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Algebra:</strong> Linear equations, systems of equations, and inequalities. This is the foundation of the test.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Math:</strong> Quadratics, exponential functions, and polynomials. Essential for scores above 600.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem-Solving and Data Analysis:</strong> Ratios, percentages, probability, and statistics.</li>
        <li><strong>Geometry and Trigonometry:</strong> Area, volume, angles, and trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Math Scoring Curve</h2>
      <p>
        The math curve can be unforgiving at the top end. On some easier test forms, missing just <strong>one question</strong> can drop your score to a 790 or even 780. On harder test forms, you might be able to miss one or two questions and still score a perfect 800.
      </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-emerald-900 mb-2">Tip: Use the Desmos Calculator</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-emerald-700">
          The Digital SAT includes a built-in Desmos graphing calculator for the entire math section. Mastering this tool is the single biggest "hack" for improving your math score. Many "hard" algebra and graphing questions can be solved in seconds by simply typing the equation into Desmos.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>How to Use This Calculator for Math Only</h2>
        <li>Check the "Math Score" output in the results section.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>How to Improve Your Math Score</h2>
      <p>
        Since the Digital SAT is adaptive, the most important strategy is to <strong>maximize your performance on Module 1</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't Rush Module 1:</strong> You need to get roughly 65-70% of questions right in Module 1 to be routed to the harder Module 2. If you fall into the easy module, your score is capped.</li>
        <li><strong>Master Desmos:</strong> Learn to use regression to solve systems of equations and find intercepts without doing any algebra by hand.</li>
        <li><strong>Plug in Answers:</strong> For multiple-choice questions, if you're stuck, try plugging the answer choices back into the problem.</li>
      </ul>
