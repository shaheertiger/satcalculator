        The Digital SAT uses a sophisticated scoring engine that adapts to your ability level in real-time. Here is exactly **how the digital SAT is scored** under the hood.

      <h2>Multistage Adaptive Testing (MST)</h2>
      <p>
        The core of the Digital SAT is <strong>Multistage Adaptive Testing (MST)</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The test is divided into two sections: Reading & Writing and Math.</li>
        <li>Each section is further divided into two <strong>modules</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Module 1</strong> contains a broad mix of Easy, Medium, and Hard questions.</li>
        <li>Your performance on Module 1 determines the difficulty of <strong>Module 2</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The "Routing" Module</h2>
      <p>
        Think of Module 1 as a placement test.
      </p>
      <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 not-prose my-8">
        <div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-xl border border-indigo-100">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-indigo-900 mb-2">Scenario A: High Performance</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-indigo-700 mb-2">
            You do well on Module 1 (typically getting ~60-70% correct).
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm font-bold text-indigo-800">
            &rarr; Routed to Hard Module 2
          </p>
          <p class="text-xs text-indigo-600 mt-2">
            Result: You face tougher questions, but your maximum score potential is capped at <strong>800</strong>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-rose-50 p-6 rounded-xl border border-rose-100">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-rose-900 mb-2">Scenario B: Low Performance</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-rose-700 mb-2">
            You struggle on Module 1 (typically getting &lt;50% correct).
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm font-bold text-rose-800">
            &rarr; Routed to Easy Module 2
          </p>
          <p class="text-xs text-rose-600 mt-2">
            Result: You face easier questions, but your score is capped. Even with a perfect Module 2, you likely won't score above <strong>600-650</strong>.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Item Response Theory (IRT)</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike paper tests where every question was worth 1 point, the Digital SAT uses <strong>Item Response Theory</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In IRT, questions have different statistical weights based on:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> How hard is the question?</li>
        <li><strong>Discrimination:</strong> How well does this question distinguish between high and low performers?</li>
        <li><strong>Guessing:</strong> How likely is a student to guess the correct answer?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This means that missing a very difficult question (which few students get right) penalizes your score much less than missing an easy question (which most students get right).
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        To get a top score on the Digital SAT, accuracy on <strong>Module 1</strong> is paramount. You must perform well enough to "unlock" the Hard Module 2, where the 700+ scores are possible.
