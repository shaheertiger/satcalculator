      <h2>How Superscoring Works</h2>
      <p>
        "Superscoring" means a college will take your highest section scores from different test dates to create a new, higher composite score.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Test 1 (March): <strong>700 Math</strong>, 600 RW = 1300 Total</li>
            <li>Test 2 (May): 650 Math, <strong>720 RW</strong> = 1370 Total</li>
            <li><strong>Superscore:</strong> 700 (Test 1 Math) + 720 (Test 2 RW) = <strong>1420 Total</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Does the Digital SAT Change Anything?</h2>
      <p>
        No. The College Board has confirmed that scores from the Digital SAT are valid for superscoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, you can even superscore a **Paper SAT** score with a **Digital SAT** score if a college accepts scores from that far back (though most students now only have Digital scores).
      </p>

      <h2>How to Send Your Superscore</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to the College Board website and navigate to "Send Scores."</li>
        <li>Select the colleges you want to apply to.</li>
        <li>Choose <strong>"Score Choice"</strong> to select which test dates to send.</li>
        <li>Send <strong>all</strong> dates that contain a highest section score. The college's admissions system will automatically calculate the superscore for you.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Which Colleges Superscore?</h2>
      <p>
        The vast majority of US colleges superscore the SAT, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ivy League:</strong> Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, UPenn, Brown, Dartmouth, Cornell.</li>
        <li><strong>Top Private Universities:</strong> Stanford, MIT, Duke, UChicago, Johns Hopkins.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Universities:</strong> UVA, UNC Chapel Hill, Georgia Tech, and many others.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Always assume a college superscores unless their website explicitly says they do not.</em>
      </p>

      <h2>Superscoring Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Knowing that superscoring exists changes how you should prep.
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Don't stress about a "perfect" single day.</strong> If you bomb the math section but get a great English score, that English score is "banked."</li>
         <li><strong>Focus on one section at a time.</strong> For your second attempt, you might spend 100% of your study time on Math, knowing your English score is already secured.</li>
      </ul>
