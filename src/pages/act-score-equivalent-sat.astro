      <h2>Why You Should Know Both Scores</h2>
      <p>
        Even if you only took the ACT, knowing your SAT equivalent is valuable. Many scholarship programs list requirements for both tests, but sometimes only one is explicitly mentioned on a flyer or website. Being able to quickly convert your score ensures you don't miss opportunities.
      </p>

      <h3>Is One Test Easier?</h3>
      <p>
        Not necessarily. The ACT is faster-paced but more straightforward. The SAT gives you more time per question but requires deeper critical thinking, especially in math. However, the <strong>concordance</strong> ensures that a "34" on the ACT represents the same level of academic achievement as a "1500" on the SAT.

      <h2>How to Choose Which Score to Send</h2>
      <p>
        If you have taken both tests, you have a strategic advantage. Use the concordance table to see which score is higher.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scenario A:</strong> You have a 30 ACT and a 1400 SAT. The concordance says a 30 ACT is roughly a 1370 SAT. Therefore, your <strong>1400 SAT is stronger</strong> and you should submit that.</li>
        <li><strong>Scenario B:</strong> You have a 32 ACT and a 1400 SAT. A 32 ACT is roughly a 1430 SAT. In this case, your <strong>32 ACT is stronger</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Always submit your strongest score. Colleges will not look down on you for submitting an ACT score over an SAT score, or vice-versa.
      </p>
