        <p>
          One of the most common questions students ask when preparing for the SAT is: <strong>can you use a calculator on the SAT?</strong> The short answer is yes, and the rules have actually gotten more favorable for test-takers since the College Board launched the Digital SAT. Whether you're wondering what calculators are allowed on the SAT, whether graphing calculators are permitted, or how the built-in Desmos calculator works, this guide covers everything you need to know.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll also walk through <strong>how SAT scores are calculated</strong>, so you understand exactly what happens after you put the calculator down and submit your test.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 1 -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-12 !mb-4" id="calculator-allowed">Can You Use a Calculator on the SAT?</h2>

        <p>
          Yes, <strong>you can use a calculator on the SAT</strong>. With the transition to the Digital SAT format, the College Board now allows calculators on the <em>entire</em> Math section. This is a significant change from the old paper-based SAT, which had a dedicated no-calculator section that many students found stressful.
        </p>
        <p>
          So if you're asking "can you use calculator for SAT math?" or "do you get a calculator on the SAT?" the answer is a definitive yes. Every math question on the Digital SAT can be answered with calculator assistance if you choose to use one.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two ways to access a calculator during the test:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Built-in Desmos graphing calculator</strong> — Embedded directly in the Bluebook testing app. Available to every student at no extra cost.</li>
          <li><strong>Your own physical calculator</strong> — You can bring your own approved calculator to the testing center.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can even use both during the test. Some students prefer their own calculator for quick arithmetic and switch to Desmos for graphing questions.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 2 -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-12 !mb-4" id="no-calculator-section">Is There a No-Calculator Section on the Digital SAT?</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>No, there is no longer a no-calculator section on the Digital SAT.</strong> This is one of the biggest changes from the old format. The paper SAT had two math sections: one that permitted calculators and one that did not. The Digital SAT eliminated this split entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Math Module 1 and Math Module 2 allow full calculator access. Whether you were routed to the easy or hard Module 2 through the adaptive testing system, calculators are permitted throughout. So if you've been searching "is there a non-calculator section on SAT" or "does the SAT have a no-calculator section" — you can stop worrying. Every math question allows calculator use.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, not every question <em>requires</em> a calculator. Many problems are designed to be solved faster through mental math or algebraic reasoning. Over-relying on your calculator can actually slow you down on simpler questions, so practice knowing when to use it and when to work through problems by hand.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 3 -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-12 !mb-4" id="approved-calculators">What Calculators Are Allowed on the SAT?</h2>

        <p>
          If you prefer to bring your own device, you need to make sure it's on the College Board's approved list. Here's a breakdown of <strong>what calculators are acceptable for the SAT test</strong>:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-6 !mb-3">Approved Calculator Types</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Graphing calculators</strong> — Most graphing calculators are allowed, including the popular TI-84 Plus, TI-84 Plus CE, TI-83 Plus, and Casio fx-9750GII. If you're asking "are graphing calculators allowed on the SAT?" — yes, they are among the most commonly used devices on test day.</li>
          <li><strong>Scientific calculators</strong> — Models like the TI-30X IIS, TI-30XS MultiView, Casio fx-300ES PLUS, and Casio fx-991EX are all permitted.</li>
          <li><strong>Four-function calculators</strong> — Basic calculators that handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are allowed but may limit you on more complex questions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-6 !mb-3">Are TI-84 Calculators Allowed on the SAT?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. The <strong>TI-84 Plus and TI-84 Plus CE are both SAT-approved calculators</strong> and are among the most widely used devices on test day. Their graphing capabilities, programmable functions, and familiar interface make them a strong choice for the SAT Math section.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-6 !mb-3">Calculators NOT Allowed on the SAT</h3>
        <p>
          The College Board prohibits the following types of devices:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Calculators with internet or wireless connectivity (phones, smartwatches, tablets)</li>
          <li>Calculators with a QWERTY keyboard (like the TI-92)</li>
          <li>Calculators that use Computer Algebra Systems (CAS), such as the TI-Nspire CAS or TI-89 Titanium</li>
          <li>Laptops or other full computers</li>
          <li>Calculators that make noise or have a paper tape</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-6 !mb-3">Are Calculator Programs Allowed on the SAT?</h3>
        <p>
          This is a gray area. The College Board does not explicitly ban programs loaded onto graphing calculators. Students can and do use pre-loaded programs on TI-84s for formulas, the quadratic equation, or distance calculations. However, you cannot access any programs that require internet access, and test proctors have the right to inspect your calculator. The safest approach is to learn the math well enough that you don't depend on custom programs.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 4 -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-12 !mb-4" id="desmos-calculator">How to Use the Desmos Calculator on the SAT</h2>

        <p>
          One of the best features of the Digital SAT is the <strong>built-in Desmos graphing calculator</strong> available in the Bluebook testing app. You don't need to bring any physical device if you're comfortable using Desmos — it's a full-featured graphing calculator that's accessible on every math question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's what you can do with the Desmos calculator on the SAT:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Graph equations</strong> — Plot linear, quadratic, polynomial, and other functions to visually identify solutions and intersections.</li>
          <li><strong>Solve systems of equations</strong> — Graph two equations and find their intersection point instead of solving algebraically.</li>
          <li><strong>Evaluate expressions</strong> — Type in any arithmetic or algebraic expression for instant computation.</li>
          <li><strong>Use tables</strong> — Generate tables of values for any function to spot patterns or verify answers.</li>
          <li><strong>Regression analysis</strong> — Fit curves to data points if needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To get comfortable with Desmos before test day, practice using the free <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Desmos online calculator</a>. The version on the SAT is nearly identical to the web version you can practice with at home. Spend time learning keyboard shortcuts and graphing techniques — students who are fluent with Desmos often save significant time on graphing and systems-of-equations problems.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 5 -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-12 !mb-4" id="how-sat-scores-calculated">How Are SAT Scores Calculated?</h2>

        <p>
          Understanding <strong>how SAT scores are calculated</strong> helps you make better use of your calculator time and set realistic score goals. Here's how the scoring process works from start to finish.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-6 !mb-3">Step 1: Raw Score</h3>
        <p>
          Your raw score is simply the <strong>number of questions you answer correctly</strong>. There is no penalty for wrong answers on the Digital SAT, so you should answer every question even if you're guessing. The Reading & Writing section has 54 total questions (27 per module), and the Math section has 44 total questions (22 per module).
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-6 !mb-3">Step 2: Adaptive Routing</h3>
        <p>
          The Digital SAT uses multistage adaptive testing. Your performance on Module 1 determines whether you're routed to an easier or harder Module 2. This routing affects your scoring ceiling:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Hard Module 2:</strong> Your section score can reach up to 800.</li>
          <li><strong>Easy Module 2:</strong> Your section score is typically capped around 600-650.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is why two students who get the same number of raw correct answers can end up with different scaled scores — the difficulty path matters.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-6 !mb-3">Step 3: Item Response Theory (IRT) Scaling</h3>
        <p>
          The College Board uses <strong>Item Response Theory</strong> to convert raw scores to scaled scores. Under IRT, each question has unique parameters for difficulty and discrimination. This means missing a hard question hurts your score less than missing an easy one. The IRT model produces a scaled score of 200-800 for each section (Reading & Writing and Math), which are combined for your total score of 400-1600.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-6 !mb-3">Step 4: Equating</h3>
        <p>
          The College Board applies equating adjustments to ensure scores are comparable across different test dates. A 1200 earned in March should represent the same ability level as a 1200 earned in October, even if one test was slightly harder. This process means the scoring curve shifts slightly from test to test.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-6 !mb-3">How to Calculate Your SAT Score from a Practice Test</h3>
        <p>
          If you've taken a practice test and want to estimate your score, here's the process:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Count your correct answers for each of the four modules (R&W Module 1, R&W Module 2, Math Module 1, Math Module 2).</li>
          <li>Determine your Module 2 difficulty routing (most official practice tests specify this).</li>
          <li>Use a <a href="/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">Digital SAT score calculator</a> to convert raw scores to estimated scaled scores using real Bluebook scoring curves.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Our <a href="/" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">free SAT score calculator</a> automates this entire process. Enter your raw module scores, select your routing difficulty, and get an instant estimated score with percentile ranking and confidence range.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 6 -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 font-heading !mt-12 !mb-4" id="calculator-tips">SAT Calculator Strategy Tips</h2>

        <p>
          Having a calculator available doesn't mean you should use it on every question. Here are strategies for making the most of your calculator on the SAT:
        </p>

        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong>Know when NOT to use it.</strong> Simple arithmetic, basic algebra, and conceptual questions are often faster without a calculator. If you reach for your calculator on every question, you're wasting valuable seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use Desmos for graphing questions.</strong> Any question that involves the graph of a function, finding intersections, or visualizing a system of equations is a perfect candidate for Desmos. Typing the equation and reading the graph is often faster than solving algebraically.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Practice with your chosen calculator.</strong> Whether you're using a TI-84, a Casio scientific calculator, or the Desmos app, practice with the same tool you'll use on test day. Familiarity matters more than the calculator's feature set.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bring fresh batteries.</strong> If you're using a physical calculator, put in fresh batteries the night before. A dead calculator mid-test is a preventable disaster. You'll still have Desmos as a backup, but switching tools under pressure is not ideal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use the calculator to check, not solve.</strong> On many problems, you can reason through the answer faster than you can punch it in. Use the calculator to verify your mental math rather than as the primary solving method.
          </li>
        </ol>

            <h3 class="text-base font-bold text-slate-800 mb-2">Can you bring your own calculator to the SAT?</h3>
            <p class="text-sm">Yes. You can bring your own approved calculator to the testing center in addition to using the built-in Desmos calculator. Many students bring a physical calculator as their primary tool and use Desmos as a backup for graphing.</p>
