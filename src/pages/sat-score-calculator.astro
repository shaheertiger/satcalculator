      <h2>How to Use This Calculator</h2>
      <p>
        The Digital SAT is adaptive, meaning your score isn't determined solely by how many questions you get right. The difficulty of the questions matters. Here is how to use our tool to get the best estimate:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Enter Reading and Writing Scores:</strong> Input the number of correct answers for Module 1 (out of 27) and Module 2 (out of 27).</li>
        <li><strong>Enter Math Scores:</strong> Input the number of correct answers for Module 1 (out of 22) and Module 2 (out of 22).</li>
        <li><strong>Select Expected Difficulty:</strong> If you performed well on Module 1, you were likely routed to the "Hard" Module 2. If you struggled, you may have received the "Easy" Module 2. Our calculator can auto-detect this based on your Module 1 score.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Understanding the 1600 Scale</h2>
      <p>
        The SAT is scored on a scale between 400 and 1600.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reading & Writing:</strong> 200–800 points</li>
        <li><strong>Math:</strong> 200–800 points</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The total score is simply the sum of these two section scores. The "raw score" (total number of correct questions) is converted to this scaled score using a process called equating, which ensures that scores are consistent across different test dates.
      </p>

      <h2>Is This Accurate for the Digital SAT?</h2>
      <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 not-prose mb-6">
        <p class="text-sm text-blue-700 m-0">
          <strong>Note:</strong> This calculator uses curves derived from official College Board Bluebook practice tests. While highly accurate for practice exams, the real SAT uses Item Response Theory (IRT) with pre-equated questions, meaning the exact weight of each question can vary slightly from test to test.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Because the Digital SAT is adaptive, two students with the same number of correct answers can receive different scores depending on which module path they took. This calculator simulates that adaptive nature to give you a realistic score range.
