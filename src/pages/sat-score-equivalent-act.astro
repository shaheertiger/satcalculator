      <h2>Why Convert Scores?</h2>
      <p>
        If you have taken both the SAT and the ACT, you should submit the score that is relatively higher. But since the scoring scales are completely different (400-1600 vs. 1-36), you need an official conversion chart to compare them.
      </p>

      <h3>How Colleges View Equivalent Scores</h3>
      <p>
        Admissions officers use these exact concordance tables to standardize applicant data. An SAT score of <strong>1400</strong> is treated as roughly equal to an ACT score of <strong>30</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sending Scores:</strong> You generally do not need to send both scores unless a specific program requests it. Send your strongest one.</li>
        <li><strong>Merit Aid:</strong> Some scholarships have specific cutoffs for each test (e.g., "1350 SAT or 29 ACT"). Always check the conversion to see if you qualify.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Strategies for High Scorers</h2>
      <p>
        If your SAT score is already in the 1500+ range, switching to the ACT acts as a "second chance" to get a perfect score. Because the ACT science section (if taken) is essentially a reading test with graphs, strong readers often find they can "superscore" their way into a top-tier college by submitting a perfect ACT instead of a near-perfect SAT.
