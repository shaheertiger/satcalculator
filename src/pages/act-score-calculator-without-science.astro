      <h2>The New ACT Format (2025-2026)</h2>
      <p>
        Starting in Spring 2025, the ACT is introducing significant changes, including making the <strong>Science section optional</strong>. This aligns the ACT more closely with the SAT, which has never had a dedicated science section.
      </p>

      <h3>How is the "No Science" ACT Scored?</h3>
      <p>
        Traditionally, the ACT Composite score was the average of four sections: English, Math, Reading, and Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to skip the Science section, your Composite score will be calculated as the average of your three remaining sections:
      </p>
      <div class="bg-indigo-50 border border-indigo-100 p-6 rounded-xl not-prose text-center my-6">
        <p class="text-xl font-bold text-indigo-900">
          (English + Math + Reading) ÷ 3
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The result is rounded to the nearest whole number. For example, if your average is 29.5, your score becomes a 30. If it is 29.33, your score remains 29.
      </p>

      <h2>Should You Skip the Science Section?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Skip it if:</strong> Science is your weakest subject and lowers your overall average. Focusing on the other three could boost your Composite score.</li>
        <li><strong>Take it if:</strong> You are applying to STEM programs (Engineering, Pre-Med, Biology) which may still require or strongly prefer seeing a Science score. Also, some highly competitive colleges may still prefer the 4-section test until new data is available.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Compare with SAT</h2>
      <p>
        Without the Science section, the ACT structure is very similar to the SAT. You can use the concordance tool below to see how your "No Science" ACT score compares to an SAT score.
